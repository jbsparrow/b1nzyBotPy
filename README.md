# b1nzyBotPy

If you for some reason decide that you would like to use this bot, I've made instructions on how to do it.

1. Create a file and name it .env
2. Put said file in the b1nzyBotPy folder
3. Put this:
TOKEN=''
YOUR_USER_ID=
FRIEND_USER_ID=
SERVER_GENERAL=
SERVER_BOT_COMMANDS=

into the .env file. Fill in the blanks with your corresponding values.
4. Install the requirements (1. cd to repo  2. type in console "pip3 install -r requirements.txt")
5. Run the bot.
