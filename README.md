###### Other Information

b1nzyBot uses a local library for NSFW content. I can't upload it to github because it's too large and there's rules surrounding NSFW content. If you do want to use the same library as b1nzyBot, I've uploaded the content to MEGA. https://mega.nz/folder/VWRA3ZbY#id9D-ehbDZ6GV0ACmQ8Dgw
