# b1nzyBotPy

If you've decided that you would like to use this pretty shit bot, I've made instructions on how to do it.

1. Create a file and name it `.env`
2. Put said file in the b1nzyBotPy folder
3. Put the text below into the `.env` file and fill in the corresponding values.
```
TOKEN=''
YOUR_USER_ID=''
FRIEND_USER_ID=''
SERVER_GENERAL=''
SERVER_BOT_COMMANDS=''
```
4. Install the requirements (1. `cd` to the repo  2. type in the console `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`) Once you've done that, type in the console `pip3 install -U discord-py-slash-command`

5. Run the bot with `python3 botMain.py` or if you're on windows `py botMain.py`
